              ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Scott McDonald, and I have been working incredibly hard towards becoming a web developer, and I have created this page to showcase the skills that I have been developing over the course of the past two years.
            </p>

            <p>
              This site was made in React using a Next.js framework, using Tailwind.CSS for styling, and is currently hosted on Vercel. I would like to note that this site is currently (and may forever be) in development, as I intend to use it as a sort of creative playground for new found skills and design concepts -- so you may see some changes should you revisit. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Please check out the about page for a brief summary of my journey in coding thus far, and be sure to pull up the project page for examples of my work. I am an artist by hobby, so I've included an artwork page with a few examples of my work.
