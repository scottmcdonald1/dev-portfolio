  `
    ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. As you probably have figured out by now, my name is Scott McDonald, and I have been working incredibly hard towards becoming a web developer.
  `, 
  `
    In mid-2020, I began teaching myself the skills and languages needed to enter the web development field, leaving my current workplace so I could devote all of my time to fast-tracking the development of my coding skills. In the summer of 2021, I completed LaunchCode's LC101 program, a Missouri-based non-profit dedicated to helping people from non-traditional backgrounds develop skills and find work within the tech community. Through this, I earned a certificate in Java and JavaScript web development and am incredibly proud of that accomplishment. Additionally, I have immersed myself in numerous self-guided tutorials through resources such as Harvard's CS50x course, FreeCodeCamp, and a few from Wes Bos, an Ontario-based web developer, educator, and podcaster.
  `, 
  `
    I am eager to apply the skills that I have developed in a professional environment. I am proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript and am most familiar with building React apps in a Next.js framework (I also have experience working in Angular). Though I feel most comfortable on the front-end, I also have ample experience with the back-end working in Java with Spring Boot. 
  `, 
  `
    Since finishing LaunchCode, I'm spending my time building small apps, learning through online tutorials, and searching for work. I have recently been honing my React skills and have taken a particular interest in working with RESTful APIs, where I have been building out middleware and using the built-in API routing with Next.js. My most recent project has been developing a Spotify API assistant, a simple, friendly search UI for navigating Spotify's API (listed in the Projects section below). The idea for the app was the product of a conversation I had with my partner, who works for a small record label in the Americana/Country/Folk world. Currently, the app is in its MVP stage and is used by at least one working professional in the music industry today.
  `, 
  `
    When not working towards a career in web development, I enjoy painting, drawing, cooking, reading, and spending time with my loving partner of 5 years, Cassie, and our rescue pitbull, Molly.
